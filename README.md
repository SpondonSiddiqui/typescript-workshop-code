# TypeScript Code Workshop


## Setting up typescript
1. Installing dependencies
   1. TypeScript (Developement dependency)
   2. Tslib, rimraf (Production dependecies)
2. Creating the configuration file
   1. Basepath
   2. Output directory
   3. Enabling import helpers (tslib)
   4. Include/Exclude
   5. Allow javascript (needed when migrating project to TypeScript)
3. Writing our first TypeScript file
   1. Create two empty files
   2. Build the project
   3. Remove one and rebuild (What happens?)
4. Setting up scripts
   1. Check types
   2. Build
   3. Clean

## Exercises
